# Frontend Development Guide

## Framework

We use basic `create-react-app` for the `client`.

## Folder Structure

`src/assets`
- static files

`src/components`
- React components

`src/entities`
- TypeScrip interfaces

`src/hooks`
- Reusable React Hooks

`src/layouts`
- React component that can wrap the children components

`src/pages`
- React components for routing

`src/reducers`
- Redux reducers

`src/services`
- axios services

`src/utils`
- utilities function

> p.s. you might see some inconsistencies, but that is the direction we are heading in. The code will be refactored to slowly merge to the idea. 

## Formatting

Please run `npm run format` before committing. There is no linting yet.

## Testing

No testing as of now, might be introduced in the future.

## CSS

We use tailwind for CSS. Please no CSS files unless necessary. Please refer to [the official documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/). If you are developing a VM client, PLEASE follow the guidelines here.
